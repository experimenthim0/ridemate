        1. Acceptance of Terms
      </h2>

        By using RideMate, you agree to these terms and conditions. Only
        registered students of the affiliated college may use this platform as
        passengers.

      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold font-[var(--font-heading)] pt-2">
        2. User Accounts
      </h2>
      <p>
        Students must provide accurate phone numbers and personal details during
        registration. Drivers are added exclusively by the platform
        administrator. Sharing login credentials is prohibited.

      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold font-[var(--font-heading)] pt-2">
        3. Booking & Payment
      </h2>
      <p>
        Bookings are subject to seat availability. Payments are made directly
        between student and driver via UPI. RideMate does not process or hold
        any payments. Payment confirmation is at the driver&apos;s discretion.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold font-[var(--font-heading)] pt-2">
        4. No-Show Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        Students who fail to show up for booked rides will receive a no-show
        mark. After 3 no-show marks, the student account will be automatically
        blocked from making new bookings. Contact the administrator to appeal.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold font-[var(--font-heading)] pt-2">
        5. Driver Block Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        Drivers reserve the right to block specific students from booking their
        rides. This may be due to misconduct, repeated no-shows, or other
        behavioral issues.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold font-[var(--font-heading)] pt-2">
        6. Disclaimer
